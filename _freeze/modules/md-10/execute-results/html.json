During class we will be using the [files in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BVi27abl-rDbxcK2aJyfz4keflBhW7Fv):  there are [four different]{.highlight-yellow} .csv files for you to work with:\n    a.  `01_binary.csv`\n    b.  `02_likert.csv`\n    c.  `03_multi-choice.csv`\n    d.  `04_text.csv`\n2.

Download a data set\n    b.  See what kind of data it is, and develop a corresponding research question (add to summary table)\n    c.  Clean the data (use R, Excel, python, etc:  whatever you like) and note your process and any challenges you faced, and how you addressed them (add to summary table)\n    d.  Analyse the data in a way that answers your research question (add result to summary table)\n4.  We will discuss the pros and cons of each question type\n5.
