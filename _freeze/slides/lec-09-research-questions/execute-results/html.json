Tilley](img/lec-08/solidwaste.png)\n\n## Course overview\n\n12:15-13:00: Introduction to Waste Management\n\n13:15-14:00: Presentation and Brainstorming with S. Kahlert, ETH Sustainability\n\n14:15-15:00: Research Questions\n\n## Learning Objectives {background-color=\"#4C326A\"}\n\n-   Learners can articulate the scale and drivers of the challenges in solid waste management\n-   Learners understand the flow of waste from Generation to Recovery\n-   Learners can identify waste management challenges at ETH and/or Zurich\n-   Learners can develop their own research questions using either the PICOT or FINER method\n\n## World challenges in solid waste are urban\n\n![[Source](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/urban-and-rural-population-in): European Environment Agency (EEA)](img/lec-08/20050_GMT2_Fig1_urban-switching.png)\n\n## Challenges of SWM\n\n-   Public health\n-   Environmental health – Local and Global\n-   Resource value\n\nSpecial concern when ecological carrying capacity is overburdened\n\n1.  Population density = risk of exposure\n2.  Waste materials properties = severity of exposure\n\n## Health Threats\n\n-   Exposure to pollutants: formal and informal workers (collectors, sorters) exposed to waste (also by flooding)\n-   Proliferation of pests: waste attract insects and rodents that carry diseases\n-   Respiratory problems due to open burning of garbage\n-   Physical risks: occupational related risk of injuries\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![26 dead in the Philippines, [2011](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2032012/Garbage-landslide-Five-people-missing-rubbish-floods-city-dump-site-walls-collapse-Typhoon-Nanmadol.html?ito=feeds-newsxml)](img/lec-08/image1.png)\n\n## Environmental Threats\n\n-   Contamination of water, soil, air…(plastics, metals, toxins, nutrients)\n-   Blockage of drains -\\> flooding -\\> erosion\n-   Deterioration of aesthetic value of landscapes (tourism)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![[Source](https://twitter.com/WorldBankWater/status/1619164654311186432): World Bank Water](img/lec-08/image14.png)\n\n## Unknown impacts\n\n-   Great Pacific Garbage Patch: 0.41 – 8.1% of Pacific Ocean\n-   Plastic facts: take \\> 400 years to degrade, bioaccumulation\n-   More than 80 % from land-based human activities\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![[Source](https://www.haultail.com/news/the-great-pacific-garbage-patch-twice-the-size-of-france-and-growing/): Haultail](img/lec-08/image5.png)\n\n## ISWM Framework\n\n![[Source](https://samim.io/p/2019-10-09-great-free-mooc-on-municipal-solid-waste-management/): samim](img/lec-08/image15.png)\n\n## 3Rs…\n\n![[Source](https://lahsecoengg.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/what-are-the-3-rs-of-solid-waste-management/): LAHS ECO Engineering](img/lec-08/image6.png)\n\n## …9Rs\n\n![[Source](https://www.gypsysoul.co.uk/the-9-rs-of-living-a-sustainable-lifestyle/): Gypsy Soul](img/lec-08/image10.png)\n\n## Generation\n\nSwitzerland has one of the highest municipal solid waste volumes in the world, at 716 kg of waste per person and year. *Nearly 53% of it is recycled.*\n\n![Waste generation versus income level by country, UNEP/ISWA (2015)](img/lec-08/image4.png)\n\n## Generation\n\n![Waste generation versus income level by country, UNEP/ISWA (2015)](img/lec-08/image9.png)\n\n## Collection and Transport\n\n![[Source](https://tma.es/en/collection-and-transportation/): TMA](img/lec-08/image2.png)\n\n## Collection and Transport\n\n![[Source](https://www.undp.org/ethiopia/blog/co-creation-reinventing-how-we-collect-and-transport-waste): UNDP](img/lec-08/image8.png)\n\n## Collection and Transport\n\n![[Source](https://www.undp.org/ethiopia/blog/co-creation-reinventing-how-we-collect-and-transport-waste): UNDP](img/lec-08/image7.png)\n\n## Treatment\n\n![Photo: E.

Waste generators – *Need to interface with the system (waste segregation?)*\n2.  Central/provincial government – *Determine strategy, policy, regulation, commitments*\n3.  Municipality – *Service provider and regulator*\n4.  NGOs & CBOs – *Awareness and self-help initiatives*\n5.  Private formal sector -- *Provide service*\n6.  Private informal sector – *Play an integral and important part in most low and middle income countries*\n7.  Internal & external support agencies – *Support and steer through funding and international conventions*\n\n## Policies\n\n-   Regulation and Enforcement\n-   Social Mobilization\n    -   Inform, education, communicate\n-   Economic Instruments\n    -   Incentives, fines\n\n## Take home messages\n\n-   Management of MSW is one of the **major challenges** worldwide\n-   The amount of waste generated is often linked directly to income level and lifestyle\n-   There is no **one-size-fits-all solution** to the SWM challenge\n-   The **socio-economic, cultural and institutional context** requires special consideration of appropriately adapted technologies, capacity building, including improvement of skills and know-how at local government level\n-   The ISWM framework is a structured assessment method to understand and find solutions to existing SWM systems.\n-   **Recovery of resources** (materials and energy) is a promising way to go in solid waste management\n",
