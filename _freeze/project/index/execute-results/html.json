Each student will collect their own data for this project, either using a survey based tool (Google Forms) or an observational study (Google Sheets). A complete report receives 30 points.\n\n## {{< fa bullseye >}} Learning Objectives\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n1. Learners are able to critically assess the data collection tools of colleagues and provide constructive feedback\n2. Learners are able to plan a self-directed sampling schedule according to their required sample size and personal limitations\n3. Learners can apply the skills obtained during the course to write a short data analysis project report.\n4. Learners can manipulate and analyse their data to answer their stated research questions\n5. Learners can critically assess their success in answering their stated research questions\n:::\n\n\n## {{< fa code >}} GitHub repository\n\nThe GitHub repository for this project was an assignment of Module 6. This repository will now be used to prepare the data and the final report:\n\n- [Module 6 - Assignment 3](../assignments/md-06/am-06-3-project.qmd): Setup your capstone project repository\n\n## {{< fa pen-clip >}} GitHub issue tracker\n\nThe GitHub issue tracker of each student's capstone project repository is used to communicate and ask questions about the Capstone Project report. It is up to the course participants to use this tool to ask questions and get feedback from the course instructors. The following GitHub usernames can be tagged: `@larnsce`, `@elizabeth-tilley`, `@bonschorno`.\n\n## {{< fa calendar-check >}} Submission due date\n\nThe due date for submission of the report is **Tuesday, 06th June 2024**.\n\n## {{< fa list-check >}} Required items\n\n@tbl-required-items is a detailed list of items that need to be included for a complete submission of the capstone project report. Items are categorized into technical, data, and intellectual tasks. If any item is unclear, please reach out to the course instructors.\n\nThis list is also accessible as a Google Sheet from where you could make yourself a copy and track your progress as a checklist:
