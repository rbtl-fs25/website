For this assignment, we ask you to:

1.  Develop a questionnaire using [Google Forms]{.highlight-yellow} to address the research question you formulated last week.
2.  Place the link to your questionnaire [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LvaClheuJszxkIbLT0L-rRHEmgL_2h2o/edit#gid=133769975) so that everyone can access it on Thursday.

In class next week, everyone will:

-   Complete everyone else's questionnaire and provide feedback in the table.
-   Download the +/- 15 responses, and we will discuss any challenges related to the raw data.

I will be available to discuss logistics, problems with questionnaires, etc. BUT if there is anything specific that anyone needs, do not hesitate to contact me [beforehand]{.highlight-yellow} (e.g. scales, buckets, etc.).
