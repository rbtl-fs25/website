## Username advice from: [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#github-acct)

You will be able to upgrade to a paid level of service, apply discounts, join organizations, etc. in the future, so don't fret about any of that now. **Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.**

A few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:

-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
-   Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
-   Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
-   Shorter is better than longer.
-   Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
-   Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.
-   Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming.
-   Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen `-`.

You can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.
