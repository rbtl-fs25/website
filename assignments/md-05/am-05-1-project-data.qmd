## Step 1: Identify data for your capstone project

Ideally, you or your organisation has a dataset that you can use for your capstone project. Note that we intend to publish the final capstone project reports as public websites and that the you chose can be shared publicly.

Data that is **not** suitable:

- household surveys with personal information about individuals
- household surveys with GPS coordinates
- sensitive data about individuals or organisations

Data that is suitable

- household surveys with aggregated data
- household surveys with no personal information about individuals and no GPS coordinates
- observational data
- laboratory data
- data from a public source

Your data format should be one of:

- CSV
- Excel
- JSON

If you do not have a dataset, you can use the following resources for inspriation:

- [World Bank DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx)
- [openwashdata long list of data resources](https://github.com/openwashdata/data/issues)
- [UNICEF Data and Analytics](https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets//)

## Step 2: Create a new repository on GitHub & clone to Posit Cloud

1. Open the GitHub Organisation for the course <https://github.com/ds4owd-001>
2. To right of the field ["Find a repository"]{.highlight-yellow}, click on the green ["New"]{.highlight-yellow} button.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/01-github-org.png")
```

3. In the ["Repository name"]{.highlight-yellow} field write `project-username`. [Replace username with your GitHub username]{.highlight-yellow}. Avoid using spaces. For example: `project-rainbow-train` for the user with the username `rainbow-train`

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/02-repository-name.png")
```

4. Scroll down on the same page, and click ["Create repository"]{.highlight-yellow}.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/03-create-repository.png")
```

5. In the ["Quick setup"]{.highlight-yellow} field, click on the clipboard next to the HTTPs URL 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/04-copy-to-clipboard.png")
```

6. Open the ds4owd workspace on [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/spaces/426916/content/all?sort=name_asc)
7. Click New Project > New Project from Git Repository
8. Paste the HTTPS URL from GitHub into the ["URL of your Git Repository"]{.highlight-yellow} field.
9. Wait until the project is deployed.

## Step 3: Create new folders

1. Navigate to the Files tab in the bottom right window of RStudio.
2. Click on the "Folder" button.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-new-folder.png")
```

3. Enter the name "data" in field and click OK.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/06-name-folder-data.png")
```

4. Click on the new `data` folder in the bottom right window.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/07-click-folder-data.png")
```

5. Click on the "Folder" button.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/08-new-folder.png")
```

6. Enter the name "raw" in field and click OK.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/09-name-folder-raw.png")
```

7. Click on the new `raw` folder in the bottom right window.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/10-click-folder-raw.png")
```

## Step 3: Upload the data 

1. Use the Files tab in the bottom right window to upload your identified data from Task 1 into the `raw` folder.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/11-upload-data.png")
```

2. Choose the file from the place you have saved it on your computer.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/12-choose-file.png")
```


## Step 4: Describe your data and goals

1. Navigate back to the root of your project folder by a click on the blue R cube.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/13-folder-root.png")
```

2. Create a new folder "docs" in the root of your project folder.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/14-new-folder.png")
```

3. Click on the `docs` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/15-click-folder-docs.png")
```

4. Create a new Quarto document and save it as `index.qmd` inside the docs folder.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/16-new-quarto-document.png")
```

5. In the `index.qmd` file, write a short description of your analysis goals and the data you have uploaded.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/17-describe-project.png")
```

5. Add a code chunk and write `library(tidyverse)` to load the R packages you have learned to work with.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
library(tidyverse)
```

6. Import your data by writing the following inside another code chunk (in this example we are using a CSV file):

```{r}
#| eval: false
read_csv(here::here("data/raw/your-file-name.csv"))
```

::: callout-tip
## The `here` R package
We recommend using the `here` R package to refer to files in your project. The `here` R package helps with finding the correct file path to your data. We will discuss file paths and the package itself in another module. 
:::

## Step 5: Commit and push your changes 

1. Navigate to the Git pane in the top-right window of RStudio
2. Check the box next to all files to stage them for a commit
3. Click on the "Commit" button
4. Enter a commit message in the "Commit message" field
5. Click on the "Commit" button
6. Click on the "Push" button
7. Enter your GitHub username and GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) in the "Username" and "Password" fields

::: callout-important
## Do not use your GitHub password

You need to enter the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) you created in Step 1 to push your changes back to GitHub.
:::

## Step 6: Open an issue on GitHub

1. Open [github.com](https://github.com/) in your browser.
2. Navigate to the GitHub organisation for the course.
3. Find the repository samples- that ends with your GitHub username.
4. Click on the "Issues" tab.
5. Click on the green "New issue" button.
6. In the "Title" field write: "Identify project data and describe analysis goals.".
7. In the "Leave a comment" field, tag the course instructors @larnsce @mianzg @sskorik01
