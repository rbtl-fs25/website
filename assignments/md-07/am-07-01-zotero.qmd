knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-restart-now.png")

10. In the **Citation keys** tab, use the following Citation key formula for Better BibTeX: `[auth:lower][year][veryshorttitle1_0:lower]`

The line above means that the citation key will be build from:

- First author's last name in lowercase
- publication year
- The first word from the title in lowercase, not including the connectors such as "the" or "a"

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-citation-keys.png")
