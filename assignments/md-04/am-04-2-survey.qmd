2. Open the md-04 folder.
3. Create a new folder and use your GitHub username as the name of the folder.

## Step 2: Create a waste management survey

**Objective**

The task is to create a survey using Google Forms to gather information on waste management practices among university students. The survey should include a variety of question types and incorporate skip logic to direct respondents based on their answers.

**Instructions**

1. Open the form you created in Step 1 of this assignment.

2. Design the survey:
   
- The survey should contain 5 to 10 questions.
- Include at least three different types of questions (e.g., multiple choice, linear scale, checkboxes, short answer).

3. Implement skip logic for one question:

- Use skip logic for a question with two alternatives, directing respondents to different sections based on their answer (this feature is only available for multiple choice and dropdown question types.)

5. Advice on sections and flow:

- Create distinct sections in your form for different topics, such as recycling habits, general waste disposal.
- Ensure the flow of the survey is logical and that skip logic is correctly implemented.

6. Finalizing and testing:
   
- Review your survey to ensure all questions are clear and the skip logic functions as intended.
- Test the survey by filling it out yourself and making adjustments as needed.

7. Prepare description

- Write up a brief (2 to 3 sentence) description at the top of the form about your survey's purpose and the insights you hope to gain from the responses.

## Step 3: Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Open the GitHub Organisation for the course <https://github.com/rbtl-fs24>
2. Create a new repository and name it: survey-USERNAME`. [Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username]{.highlight-yellow}. Avoid using spaces.

## Step 4: Open an issue on GitHub

1. Open an issue on GitHub on your survey-USERNAME repo 
2. Paste the link to your survey in the body of the issue and tag the course instructor `@larnsce`.
