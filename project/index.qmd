## {{< fa code >}} GitHub repository

A repository for each student is established. This repository contains self-identified data that was shared in week 3 of the course. Some data cleaning steps are performed by the course instructor, so that each student has a tidy dataset to work with.

The repository further contains an empty Quarto file (report.qmd), which students must use to write their report. A list of graded items was prepared to guide students in writing the report.

## {{< fa pen-clip >}} GitHub issue tracker

The GitHub issue tracker of each student's capstone project repository is used to communicate and ask questions about the Capstone Project report.

## {{< fa calendar-check >}} Submission due date

The due date for submission of the report is **Friday, 28th July**. Any commits after the due date will not be counted against the graded items. 

## {{< fa list-check >}} Graded items

@tbl-grading-items is a detailed list of items for grading of the capstone project report are presented. The sum of points is 100 and spread over technical and intellectual items as presented in @tbl-grading-categories.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-grading-items
#| tbl-cap: "List of items and points for grading of the capstone project report."

grading %>% 
  select(category, items, points) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-grading-categories
#| tbl-cap: "Sum of points for technical and intellectual part of report."

grading |> 
  group_by(category, description) |> 
  summarise(points = sum(points)) |>
