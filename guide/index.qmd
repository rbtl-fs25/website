This guide documents features of R, RStudio, Posit Cloud, and Quarto, which are relevant throughout the course. These can settings that need to be made or tips that we communicate during the live sessions. 

If you have a request, let us know and we will add guidance here.

## Switch pipe operator

By default, R uses `%>%` as the pipe operator from the `magrittr` package. Since R 4.1.0, the pipe operator is also available as `|>` without loading any packages. The `|>` operator is recommended to be used instead of `%>%`.

To switch to the native pipe operator, follow these steps:

1. Open your project on Posit Cloud
2. On the menu bar of RStudio, click on `Tools` > `Global Options...` (see @fig-global-options)
3. On the left panel, click on `Code`
4. On the right panel, select the 4th check-box from the top next to 'Use native pipe operator, |> (requires R 4.1+) (see @fig-native-pipe)
5. Click on `Apply` and `OK`

```{r}
#| label: fig-global-options
#| fig-cap: RStudio Global Options
#| out-width: 75%
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-tools-global-options.png")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-native-pipe
#| fig-cap: RStudio Code Options
#| out-width: 75%
knitr:::include_graphics("images/rstudio-code-native-pipe.png")
```

## Zotero reference management

We recommend using Zotero as a tool for reference management, but do not teach how to use it in this course. The guidance below will support you in setting up Zotero.

### Get Zotero account

1. Open <https://www.zotero.org/user/login/>
2. Click on Register for a free account
3. Chose username, email, and password
4. Click Register
5. Open your email and verify your account

### Install Zotero desktop client

1. Open <https://www.zotero.org/download/>
2. Download Zotero for your operating system
3. Install Zotero
4. Log in to your Zotero account by opening **Settings -> Sync** and typing the Username and Password you have previously set up
5. Click on the green refresh button in the top-right corner of the Zotero window

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-zotero-desktop-client-refresh.png")
```

### Install the Zotero Connector for your browser

1. Open <https://www.zotero.org/download/>
2. Download the Zotero Connector for your browser
3. Install the Zotero Connector
4. Log in to your Zotero account

### Setup Add-ons and the citation key format

1. Go to <https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/>
2. Click on the latest release so you are redirected to github
3. Find the .xpi file and right-click it. Click on **Save Link As...** and choose your location for saving the file.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-zotero-better-bibtex-addon.png")
```

4. Open **Zotero** -> **Tools** -> **Add-ons** -> (Gear icon) -> **Install Add-on From File...** -> choose the .xpi file you have just saved

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-install-betterbibtex-addon.png")
```

5. Restart Zotero

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-restart-now.png")
```

6. Wait until the database fully loads. Only the first time is long; the next interactions with Zotero will be much faster.

7. You may need to restart Zotero the second time. Please do so if you see a prompt after Better BibTeX is installed.

8. Go to **Zotero** -> **Settings** -> **Export** -> **Default Format** and change the default format to **Better BibTeX Quick Copy: \cite{citation keys}**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-install-betterbibtex-addon.png")
```

9. In the same setting window, go to **Better BibTeX** -> **Open Better BibTeX preferences...**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-betterbibtex-preferences.png")
```

10. In the **Citation keys** tab, use the following Citation key formula for Better BibTeX: `[auth:lower][year][veryshorttitle1_0:lower]`

The line above means that the citation key will be build from:

- First author's last name in lowercase
- publication year
- The first word from the title in lowercase, not including the connectors such as "the" or "a"

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-citation-keys.png")
```

11. Go to **Export** -> **Quick-Copy** in the Better BibTeX preferences. Select **Pandoc citation**.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-pandoc-citation.png")
```


### Change the setting for the citekey autopin delay

1. Open Zotero advanced preferences (**Zotero** -> **Settings** -> **Advanced**)
2. Open the **Config Editor** under the **Advanced Configuration** section

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-advanced-config.png")
```

3. Click **I accept the risk!**
4. In the search bar, search for **autopin**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-autopin.png")
```

5. Double-click into the field under **Value**
6. In the new window called **Enter integer value**, change the existing **0** to **2**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/screenshot-autopin-value-2.png")
```

7. Click **OK**
8. Close all setting windows
