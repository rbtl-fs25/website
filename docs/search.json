Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.\nA few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:\n\nIncorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.\nReuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.\nPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.\nShorter is better than longer.\nBe as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.\nMake it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.\nAvoid words laden with special meaning in programming.\nAvoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen -.\n\nYou can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Register for an ORCID iD\n\nCreate your ORCID iD at: https://orcid.org/register\n\nLearn more about ORCID and why you should get one, even if your are not a researcher or working in academia.\n\n\n Step 3: Fill out our registration form\n\nFill out this form: https://forms.gle/JvPfVubntbaDrNZQ8\n\n\n\n Step 4: Register for the scheduled Zoom meetings\n\nRegister here: https://ethz.zoom.us/meeting/register/u5EsdO6vqjkqGtBNj9qCUXVOXy8hPobo3hI2"

Do not access the data from Google Drive, but rather use the read_csv() function to access your data from the data/raw folder. Save the processed, analysis-ready data in the data/processed folder using the write_csv() function.

The here::here() function is a best practice for creating file paths in R scripts and Quarto documents. It is beneficial when working with RStudio Projects because it allows you to write file paths relative to your RStudio Project’s root directory.\nThe details\nThat’s the short version, the extended version needs a more detailed explanation of how file paths work in .R scripts, Quarto documents and RStudio Projects (.Rproj).

    "text": "Step 2: Create a waste management survey\nObjective\nThe task is to create a survey using Google Forms to gather information on waste management practices among university students. The survey should include a variety of question types and incorporate skip logic to direct respondents based on their answers.\nInstructions\n\nOpen the form you created in Step 1 of this assignment.\nDesign the survey:\n\n\nThe survey should contain 5 to 10 questions.\nInclude at least three different types of questions (e.g., multiple choice, linear scale, checkboxes, short answer).\n\n\nImplement skip logic for one question:\n\n\nUse skip logic for a question with two alternatives, directing respondents to different sections based on their answer (this feature is only available for multiple choice and dropdown question types.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: How to use skip logic in Google Forms survey?\n\n\n\nAnswer from perplexity.ai: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/How-to-use-787pv.4nRo6omKzCpHK6Xg\n\n\n\nSome example questions:\n\n\nMultiple choice (with skip logic): “Do you currently separate your waste for recycling?”\n\nIf “Yes,” skip to questions about recycling habits.\nIf “No,” skip to questions about barriers to recycling.\n\nCheckboxes: “Which of the following materials do you recycle? (Select all that apply)”\n\nOptions: Paper, Plastic, Glass, Metal, Electronics, Organic Waste.\n\nShort answer: “What challenges do you face in managing waste effectively?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for creating a survey\n\n\n\n\nKeep questions clear and concise.\nEnsure skip logic enhances the survey experience and does not confuse respondents.\nConsider privacy and anonymity when collecting responses.\n\n\n\n\nAdvice on sections and flow:\n\n\nCreate distinct sections in your form for different topics, such as recycling habits, general waste disposal.\nEnsure the flow of the survey is logical and that skip logic is correctly implemented.\n\n\nFinalizing and testing:\n\n\nReview your survey to ensure all questions are clear and the skip logic functions as intended.\nTest the survey by filling it out yourself and making adjustments as needed.\n\n\nPrepare description\n\n\nWrite up a brief (2 to 3 sentence) description at the top of the form about your survey’s purpose and the insights you hope to gain from the responses.",

You find yourself within an environment for (scientific) computing. R is a programming language for scientific computing and the additionally taught tools (e.g. Quarto) and workflows (version control) to combine R in a writing and publishing workflow. We also touch on some data management topics (Data Organisation in Spreadsheet) without getting into much detail about file management in general. As part of your final capstone project, you will practice active research data management by documenting your data with a data dictionary and completing a README template used to describe your data.\nThe following paper provides recommendations for some of the practices we use in class and puts them into the context of organising your data analysis work. That can be research and academic work, but is just as relevant if you are a consultant, working for an NGO, government, and others.\nFor this assignment, we ask you to:\n\nRead Wilson et al.

    "text": "Homework\nThe papers we will study are available to download here and can also be found in the Readings section of Module 08.\nEach group has been assigned a paper to read. The paper allocation list can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4qA_FOtZBGn1RL4pzfvTq-hb9-pXnH58oyY0n1nAog/edit#gid=0\nFour people have been assigned to each paper and each group will be responsible for the following tasks:\n\nYour group will have 5 minutes to give a 3-slide overview of the\n\nResearch Question\nSampling strategy (who or what did they sample, measure)\nKey findings (focus on 1 key figure or outcome that best answers the research question)\n\n\nFollowed by 2 minutes for any clarifying questions from the audience. Complete comprehension is not required, but the whole class should be have a general understanding of what the paper was about\n\nYour group will then share the questionnaire that you have created. Your data questionnaire will be your attempt to “reverse engineer” the data that was used to generate the results of the paper. Ask yourself: “in order to use the data that was collected, what is the best way to collect it before analysis”. Before class you will create a shared google sheet with:\n\nTab 1: The questionnaire that would have been generated for this research (i.e. the questions, the options, unites etc.)\nTab 2: The codebook with the variables and their units\nTab 3: A sample spreadsheet of how the data would look in its raw, unprocessed form (i.e. an empty spreadsheet with rows and columns clearly labelled), taking into account the research design (i.e. was the data collected multiple times over a period of time; was data collected from multiple sources and compared, etc.)\nTab 3, 4, 5: a copy of the sample spreadsheet/data frame for each of the other groups to work on during the collaborative session (more on that below)\n\n\nFor example: If we have this figure on the age gap between men and women:\n\nOur questionnaire would look like this:\n\nWhat’s your gender? (pick one)\n\n\nfemale\nmale\nnon-binary\nprefer not to say\n\n\nWhat’s your income? (numeric value, in USD per week)\nWhat year is it? (numeric value, YYYY)\n\nOur data table would look like this:\n\n\n\nyear\ngender\nincome\n\n\n\n\n1980\nmale\n400\n\n\n1980\nfemale\n240\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\n2020\nmale\n450\n\n\n2020\nfemale\n360\n\n\n\n*It is not necessary to fill in the values: just construct the dataframe\n\nThe class will then have 5 minutes to work on their own copy of the dataframe (on their own tab). Specifically, each group (that did not read the paper) will\n\nAdd variables that have been omitted\nMake changes to the table structure\nRevise the coding, codebook, units, etc.\n\nWhile the other groups are working on the edits, the presenting group will click through the different tabs and “harvest” the ideas that make sense and revise their own, original table.\nThe presenting group will then have 5 minutes to summarise to the class what changes they made and why. We will collect all of the feedback on each round of revisions (i.e. all 4 papers) so that at the end of class we can consolidate the ideas and try to explain: what makes a good data structure?\n\nBy the end of the first 2 hours, you will have worked on the data tables from four different papers and will have gained a lot of insights into what works and what doesn’t. At the end of the class we aggregate what we learned from these exercises so that we can transfer these insights into our own projects and be able to identify the factors that make a data set good.\nWe will structure the consolidation section of the class by trying to identify what makes a good data structure for analysis so that we can compile a list of quality assessment criteria. We will compile the feedback according to the following themes:\n\nPatterns: what were good and/or bad things that you noticed repeating. What were the consistent mistakes and in turn, the consistently successful factors?\nGaps: what did we forget? What was often missing? And how did we fix these challenges?\nLogic: Where did we get stuck on the interpretation from the end result to the data? What logical errors did we make and how can we avoid them going forward?\nPriorities: We couldn’t do everything (all variables, all figures) and will never be able to. When thinking about your own data, what priorities should we consider; what factors can we let slide?\n\nBy the end, we will have a comprehensive overview of what a good data structure looks like that we can apply to our own projects!",

    "text": "1 General information\n\nbring your laptop and charger\nyou will use the Posit Cloud infrastructure, as we used it in class\nyou will not use GitHub or Git in the exam; you will start directly from Posit Cloud\nthe exam is purely technical and tests your competency in R and Quarto\nthe coding tasks are similar to the weekly assignments, and there will be one debugging task (a Quarto file with errors that you need to fix so that the file renders and displays all elements correctly)\nyou can use any material for the exam (search engine, AI tools, etc.). If you use AI for a solution, please include a link to your prompt, as covered in the AI policy for class (https://rbtl-fs24.github.io/website/#ai-policy)\nyou are not allowed to speak to your peers, either directly or through a messenger app\n\nThe core challenge of the exam will be time pressure. You can prepare best for the exam by organising yourself in your browser (e.g., have organised bookmarks for the homework assignments on Posit Cloud, learn how documentation on www.quarto.org is organised, have prompt templates for AI tools, etc.). It’s everything that I would expect someone to have for working efficiently in a day-to-day data science job).\n\n\n2 Structure\nThe exam consists of five sections, each of which is a .qmd file (e.g. section-01.qmd). The total amount of points is 54, which means you could achieve 104 points in the overall course. The number of points for each section are displayed at the top of each section and for each task.\n\n\n3 Hand-in\nEach section has a “hand-in” task at the bottom. The 0.5 points for that task are for a file that renders without error. If the file does not render because you have errors, you would still get all points for the tasks you have completed, also for partial solutions.\n\n\n4 Time\nThe duration for the exam is two hours. At the end of the two hours, you are expected to stop working on the tasks. The course instructor can monitor when the file was last edited.",
