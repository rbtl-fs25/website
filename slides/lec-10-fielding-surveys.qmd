## #1: Know What a Survey Can (Not) Do 

### Can: 

* Gather (a lot of) data (e.g., ratings, frequencies, opinions) 
* Provide standardized data (all respondents answer the same questions, allowing for consistent and comparable data) 

### Can Not: 

* Capture the full complexity of human behavior (we’re irrational every now and then) 
* Eliminate bias (e.g., social desirability bias, acquiescence bias, recall bias) 

## #2: Single-Subject Rule for Every Question 

A concept borrowed from constitutional law: A survey question may deal with only one issue. 

### Good: 

*"On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is 'very dissatisfied' and 5 is 'very satisfied,' how satisfied are you with the speed of our online checkout process?"* 

### Bad: 

*"How satisfied are you with our product's price and customer service, and would you recommend it to a friend?"*

**Pro Tip:** Assign the corresponding research question to each and every question. This helps you to see if the survey question (partially) allows you to answer your research questions. 

## #3: Diminishing Marginal Utility of Questions 

* We all want to answer as many questions as possible (after all, you never know if you might need the information later), but please don’t 
* Survey fatigue is a big issue 
* Be honest with yourself: Are you really going to analyze the answers afterwards? 
* **Rule of thumb:** If you’re not sure if you should include the question, don’t include it. 
* Also, respondents incur opportunity costs for taking the time to answer your questions. Make sure it’s worth their time.

## #4: Structure Your Survey (Visually) 

* Work with groups, colors, sections, tabs, etc.

## #5: As Many Checks as Possible 

* The more logical incoherences you can anticipate the better! 

#### Example: 

Survey Question 1: "What is your age?" \[answer\_q1] 

Survey Question 2: "How many years have you been driving?” \[answer\_q2] 

**Logical Check:** The response to \[answer\_q2] should not exceed the response to \[answer\_q1] minus the legal driving age in the respondents area. 

Implementation: If \[answer\_q2] > (\[answer\_q1] - 18) (assuming 18 is the legal driving age), display an error message: *"Please correct your response. The number of years you have been driving cannot exceed your age minus the legal driving age."*

## #6: Open-ended Questions 

* You can’t think of every possible option in close-ended question, so open-ended questions can be a good option 
* However, more often than not, they tend to clutter your survey and since the data is unstructured, it is a lot harder to analyze 
* Pro tip: You can include open-ended questions during a pilot (see Tip #8), see if there are answer options haven’t thought about and then include them in an updated close-ended question 

## #7: Think About Data Analysis Already 

* Name variables consistently (e.g., firstword\_secondword or FirstwordSecondword) 
* Prefixes for groups (e.g., nutrition\_item1, nutrition\_item2, nutrition\_outlook, nutrition\_cycle) 
* Use meaningful labels (e.g., “morning”, “noon”, “evening” instead of 1,2,3) 

## #8 Soft Launch Your Survey 

* As much as you anticipate, you will only really know if your survey works once it’s out in the real world. 
* Send it to friends and colleagues to test it. 
* Ideally, you go through several iterations of soft launches before you field the actual survey. 

## #9: Provide the Full Package

* Don't just publish the final analysis.

**Publish Also…**

* The raw data 
* The questionnaire 
* The sampling frame 
* Additional files like photos or recordings if not 
* The data processing files 
* The analysis scripts 

## #Bonus: Cultural Sensitivity 

* Ensure accurate translation by native speakers, not just literal translations. 
* Avoid questions that may be considered taboo or offensive in certain cultures. 
* Allow for diverse responses and avoid imposing Western-centric categories.
* Consider color symbolism, as colors can have different meanings in different cultures. 
* Choose distribution methods that are accessible and culturally appropriate for the target population.
