# Part 1: Homework module 6 {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Metadata: data about data

WHAT!?

## Faecal sludge samples

Imagine:

- you are new to WASH research and you have never heard of feacal sludge management. 
- you are interested in learning more about the topic and you want to find some data to play with. 
- you find a publication with a dataset on faecal sludge characteristics. 

## Faecal sludge samples

You download the XLSX file that contains the data and you open it in Excel. You see the following:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-07/sludge-xlsx.png")
```

## Faecal sludge samples {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Open questions:

- What unit does `users` refer to?
- What does `ts` stand for?
- The `date` of what?
- Where was this data collected?
- Which method was used to collect the samples?

# Part 3: Reference Management {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Four terms

- Citation
- Reference
- Bibliography
- Citation Style Language (CSL)

## What's a Citation?

::: {.incremental}

- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [@kalina2023rich].
- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021my].
- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.

::: 

::: {.notes}
**Explanation**
A citation is a reference to the source of information used in your research. Any time you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize the essential elements of someone else's idea in your work, an in-text citation should follow. For example, in APA style, a citation might look like this: (Tilley and Kalina, 2021). 

**Analogy**
Think of a citation as a signpost on a road trip. It tells you where the information came from and points you in the direction of the full details (the destination), which can be found in the reference list.
:::

## What's a Citation?

- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [[@kalina2023rich].]{.highlight-yellow}
- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [[@tilley2021my].]{.highlight-yellow}
- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.


::: {.callout-important}
## Important: The period is **after** the citation.
:::

## What's a Reference?

- detailed description of the source of information
- author's name, title, year of publication, publisher, DOI, etc.

Tilley, E., & Kalina, M. (2021). “My flight arrives at 5 am, can you pick me up?”: The gatekeeping burden of the african academic. *Journal of African Cultural Studies, 33*(4), 538–548. [https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000493677](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000493677)

 
::: {.notes}

**Explanation**

A reference is a detailed description of the source of information that you want to give credit to via a citation. In APA style, a reference provides comprehensive details about a source, including the author's name, the title of the source, the year of publication, and the publisher or URL.

**Analogy**

A reference is like a detailed map at the end of your road trip (paper). It provides all the details about the source (destination) that the citation (signpost) pointed to.

::: 

## What's a Bibliography?

::: large

- list of references in a research paper or project
- includes all sources used, whether they were directly quoted or not
- listed alphabetically by the author's last name in the reference list

:::

### References

::: {#refs}
:::

## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?

- It's what your citation and generated bibliography look like
- APA (American Psychological Association) Style, Chicago Style, IEEE Style, Vancouver Style, etc. (over 10,000 styles in [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles))

::: {.notes}
The Citation Style Language (CSL) describes the formatting of citations, notes, and bibliographies. It was created to provide an open format that can be used by any application
:::

## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?

[author-date:]{.highlight-yellow}  Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021my].

[numeric]{.highlight-yellow}  Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [[1]]().

## Why use a reference management tool?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Managing references manually:

- is a lot of work 
- is prone to mistakes
- makes you lose track
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Why use Zotero?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- free
- open source: developed in public

**Mendeley**

1. Mendeley is owned by Elsevier. 
2. It encrypts your database and makes money with your data
3. You can only collaborate with 3 people on one project.

**EndNote**

1. EndNote doesn't come free, you need to buy a license. 
2. They also used a prioprietary citation style files that could only be opened by EndNote.

## Scholarly Articles in Quarto

Quarto supports

::: incremental
-   a standardized schema for authors and affiliations that can be expressed once int the source document,

-   the use of Citation Style Language (CSL) to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies, and

-   outputting to `pdf`, `html`, and `docx` with custom formatting,
:::

. . .

according to the styles required for various journals,

. . .

and creating the LaTeX required for submission to multiple journals.

## Front matter

Quarto provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe the details required in the front matter of scholarly articles. 

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-  title
-  author
-  affiliation
-  abstract
-  keywords
-  citation
-  licensing
- etc.
