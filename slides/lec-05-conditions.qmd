# Homework module 4 {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Part 1: Reading

1.  Read @broman2018data: ["Data organization in spreadsheets"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989).
2.  Chose two of the recommendations and come up with [real-world examples]{.highlight-yellow} or scenarios where the recommendations could be applied in your work.
3.  Be prepared to share these examples and [explain how the recommendations would improve your workflows]{.highlight-yellow}. This will be in a class setting as part of small discussion group (max 3 people).

## Your turn: Discuss the reading

::: task
In discussion groups of 3, share your examples and discuss how the recommendations would improve your workflows.

## Rules for variable names

-   avoid spaces
-   avoid special characters
-   use consistent naming conventions (e.g. snake_case)

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
**use**

-   ts
-   users
-   system
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
**avoid**

-   Total Solids (g/L)
-   Number of users
-   System (pit latrine / septic tank)
:::
:::

## Data dictionary / codebook

-   variable descriptions belong into a data dictionary / codebook (not into variable names)
-   data dictionaries / codebooks are separate files

. . . 

| variable_name | description                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ts            | Total solids in g/L.                                                    |
| users         | Number of users per system.                                             |
| system        | Sanitation system in use at sample location (septic tank / pit latrine). |

# Conditional statements {background-color="#4C326A"}

## dplyr functions `mutate()` & `case_when()`

-   `mutate()` adds new variables to a data frame
-   `case_when()` is another form of an if-else statement
-   combination of functions are used to create variables with new values or fix existing ones

## My turn: Conditional statements

## Task 1 {.scrollable}

1.  A mistake happened during data entry for sample id 16. Use `mutate()` and `case_when()` to change the ts value of 0.72 to 8.72.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts = case_when(
        ts ==  0.72 ~ 8.72,
        .default = ts
    ))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts = case_when(
        ts ==  0.72 ~ 8.72,
        .default = ts
    )) |> 
  gt()
```

## Task 2

1.  Another mistake happened during data entry for sample id 6. Use `mutate()` and `case_when()` to change the system value of id 6 from "pit latrine" to "septic tank".

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sludge |> 
    mutate(system = case_when(
        id ==  6 ~ "septic tank",
        .default = system
    ))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sludge |> 
    mutate(system = case_when(
        id ==  6 ~ "septic tank",
        .default = system
    )) |> 
  gt()

```

## Task 3 (stretch goal)

1.  Add a new variable with the name `ts_cat` to the dataframe. that categorises sludge samples into low, medium and high solids content.Use `mutate()` and `case_when()` to create the new variable.

-   samples with less than 15 g/L are categorised as low
-   samples with 15 g/L to 50 g/L are categorised as medium
-   samples with more than 50 g/L are categorised as high

## Task 3 (stretch goal)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts_cat = case_when(
        ts < 15 ~ "low",
        ts >= 15 & ts <= 50 ~ "medium",
        ts > 50 ~ "high"
    ))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts_cat = case_when(
        ts < 15 ~ "low",
        ts >= 15 & ts <= 50 ~ "medium",
        ts > 50 ~ "high"
    )) |> 
  gt()
```

## Task 3 (stretch goal)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts_cat = case_when(
        ts < 15 ~ "low",
        ts >= 15 & ts <= 50 ~ "medium",
        ts > 50 ~ "high"
    )) |> 
  count(ts_cat)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sludge |> 
    mutate(ts_cat = case_when(
        ts < 15 ~ "low",
        ts >= 15 & ts <= 50 ~ "medium",
        ts > 50 ~ "high"
    )) |> 
    count(ts_cat) |>

# Dates and times {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Dates and times in R

-   Dates and times are stored as numbers in R
-   Dates are stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01
-   Times are stored as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
-   Dates and times are stored as numeric values, but can be formatted to look like dates and times

# Tables display {background-color="#4C326A"}

## R packages for displaying tables

-   Many packages for displaying tables in R
-   `gt` package is one of the most popular and flexible
-   `kable()` function of `knitr` package useful for simple tables

# Cross references {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Cross references

-   Help readers to navigate your document with numbered references and hyperlinks to entities like figures and tables.

-   Cross referencing steps:

    -   Add a caption to your figure or table.
    -   Give an ID to your figure or table, starting with `fig-` or `tbl-`.
    -   Refer to it with `@fig-...` or `@tbl-...`.

## Table cross references {.smaller}

The presence of the caption (`A few penguins`) and label (`#tbl-penguins`) make this table referenceable:

See `@tbl-penguins` for data on a few penguins.

becomes:

See @tbl-penguins for data on a few penguins.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: tbl-penguins
#| tbl-cap: A few penguins
