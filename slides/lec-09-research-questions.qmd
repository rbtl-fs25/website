## Week 8: Solid Waste Management

## Course overview

12:15-13:00: Introduction to Waste Management

13:15-14:00: Presentation and Brainstorming with S. Kahlert, ETH Sustainability

14:15-15:00: Research Questions

## Learning Objectives {background-color="#4C326A"}

-   Learners can articulate the scale and drivers of the challenges in solid waste management
-   Learners understand the flow of waste from Generation to Recovery
-   Learners can identify waste management challenges at ETH and/or Zurich
-   Learners can develop their own research questions using either the PICOT or FINER method

## World challenges in solid waste are urban

## Challenges of SWM

-   Public health
-   Environmental health – Local and Global
-   Resource value

Special concern when ecological carrying capacity is overburdened

1.  Population density = risk of exposure
2.  Waste materials properties = severity of exposure

## Health Threats

-   Exposure to pollutants: formal and informal workers (collectors, sorters) exposed to waste (also by flooding)
-   Proliferation of pests: waste attract insects and rodents that carry diseases
-   Respiratory problems due to open burning of garbage
-   Physical risks: occupational related risk of injuries

## Environmental Threats

-   Contamination of water, soil, air…(plastics, metals, toxins, nutrients)
-   Blockage of drains -\> flooding -\> erosion
-   Deterioration of aesthetic value of landscapes (tourism)

## Unknown impacts

-   Great Pacific Garbage Patch: 0.41 – 8.1% of Pacific Ocean
-   Plastic facts: take \> 400 years to degrade, bioaccumulation
-   More than 80 % from land-based human activities

## …9Rs

## Generation

Switzerland has one of the highest municipal solid waste volumes in the world, at 716 kg of waste per person and year. *Nearly 53% of it is recycled.*

## Recycling

## Stakeholders

1.  Waste generators – *Need to interface with the system (waste segregation?)*
2.  Central/provincial government – *Determine strategy, policy, regulation, commitments*
3.  Municipality – *Service provider and regulator*
4.  NGOs & CBOs – *Awareness and self-help initiatives*
5.  Private formal sector -- *Provide service*
6.  Private informal sector – *Play an integral and important part in most low and middle income countries*
7.  Internal & external support agencies – *Support and steer through funding and international conventions*

## Policies

-   Regulation and Enforcement
-   Social Mobilization
    -   Inform, education, communicate
-   Economic Instruments
    -   Incentives, fines

## Take home messages

-   Management of MSW is one of the **major challenges** worldwide
-   The amount of waste generated is often linked directly to income level and lifestyle
-   There is no **one-size-fits-all solution** to the SWM challenge
-   The **socio-economic, cultural and institutional context** requires special consideration of appropriately adapted technologies, capacity building, including improvement of skills and know-how at local government level
-   The ISWM framework is a structured assessment method to understand and find solutions to existing SWM systems.
-   **Recovery of resources** (materials and energy) is a promising way to go in solid waste management
