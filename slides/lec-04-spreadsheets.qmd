## Types of variables - Remember?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### numerical

**discrete variables**

-   non-negative
-   whole numbers
-   e.g. number of students, roll of a dice

**continuous variables**

-   infinite number of values
-   also dates and times
-   e.g. length, weight, size
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### non-numerical

[**categorical variables**]{.highlight-yellow}

-   finite number of values
-   distinct groups (e.g. EU countries, continents)
-   [**ordinal**]{.highlight-yellow} if levels have natural ordering (e.g. week days, school grades)
