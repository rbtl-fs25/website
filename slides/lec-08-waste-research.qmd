## Course overview

# Introduction to Waste Management {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Learning Objectives

-   Learners can articulate the scale and drivers of the challenges in solid waste management
-   Learners understand the flow of waste from Generation to Recovery
-   Learners can identify waste management challenges at ETH and/or Zurich
-   Learners can develop their own research questions using either the PICOT or FINER method

## World challenges in solid waste are urban

## Challenges of SWM

-   Public health
-   Environmental health – Local and Global
-   Resource value

Special concern when ecological carrying capacity is overburdened

1.  Population density = risk of exposure
2.  Waste materials properties = severity of exposure

## Health Threats

-   Exposure to pollutants: formal and informal workers (collectors, sorters) exposed to waste (also by flooding)
-   Proliferation of pests: waste attract insects and rodents that carry diseases
-   Respiratory problems due to open burning of garbage
-   Physical risks: occupational related risk of injuries

## Environmental Threats

-   Contamination of water, soil, air…(plastics, metals, toxins, nutrients)
-   Blockage of drains -\> flooding -\> erosion
-   Deterioration of aesthetic value of landscapes (tourism)

## Unknown impacts

-   Great Pacific Garbage Patch: 0.41 – 8.1% of Pacific Ocean
-   Plastic facts: take \> 400 years to degrade, bioaccumulation
-   More than 80 % from land-based human activities

## …9Rs

## Generation

Switzerland has one of the highest municipal solid waste volumes in the world, at 716 kg of waste per person and year. *Nearly 53% of it is recycled.*

## Recycling

![[Source](https://livingin.swiss/recycling-in-luzern/): LivingIn](img/lec-08/image3.png)

## Stakeholders

1.  Waste generators – *Need to interface with the system (waste segregation?)*
2.  Central/provincial government – *Determine strategy, policy, regulation, commitments*
3.  Municipality – *Service provider and regulator*
4.  NGOs & CBOs – *Awareness and self-help initiatives*
5.  Private formal sector -- *Provide service*
6.  Private informal sector – *Play an integral and important part in most low and middle income countries*
7.  Internal & external support agencies – *Support and steer through funding and international conventions*

## Policies

-   Regulation and Enforcement
-   Social Mobilization
    -   Inform, education, communicate
-   Economic Instruments
    -   Incentives, fines

## Take home messages

-   Management of MSW is one of the **major challenges** worldwide
-   The amount of waste generated is often linked directly to income level and lifestyle
-   There is no **one-size-fits-all solution** to the SWM challenge
-   The **socio-economic, cultural and institutional context** requires special consideration of appropriately adapted technologies, capacity building, including improvement of skills and know-how at local government level
-   The ISWM framework is a structured assessment method to understand and find solutions to existing SWM systems.
-   **Recovery of resources** (materials and energy) is a promising way to go in solid waste management

# Research Questions {background-color="#4C326A"}

## Finding the right research question early will save you a lot of headaches later

The research question will influence

-   Who or what you sample
-   The research design you use (we will discuss Week 9)
-   The type of analysis you use

## As Dr. Fandino states:

“...up to one third of the time spent in the whole process… \[should\] be invested in finding the right primary study question”

## Compare the examples

1.  Do supraglottic devices provide similar conditions for the visualization of the glottis aperture in a German hospital?

versus

2.  Among children younger than 1 year of age undergoing elective minor procedures, to what extent the insertion times are different, comparing the Supreme laryngeal mask airway (LMA) to Proseal LMA, when placed after reaching a BIS index \<60?

## Let’s examine the first question

Do supraglottic devices provide similar conditions for the visualization of the glottis aperture in a German hospital?

1.  “Do these devices…provide similar conditions…” implies a YES or NO answer ❌

NEVER ask a yes or no question!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

❌ Is the city of Zurich able to recycle all of its plastic?\

❌ Does the city of Zurich recycle all of its plastic?

❌ Do people recycle plastic?


✅ What percentage of waste is the city of Zurich able to recycle?

✅ How much does it cost to recycle all of the plastic in Zurich?

✅ Who are the residents most likely to recycle plastic?

## To help us define the key components of a Research Question we use the PICOT Framework

* Population
* Intervention
* Comparator
* Outcome
* Timeframe

With many clarifying questions spelled out in the paper.  Even when we don’t really understand the research topic, we should be able to identify the components of PICOT

## “Interventions” are common in medicine, economics, engineering

* What is the impact of extra sleep on student grades?
* What is the impact of a cash payment on the rate of mothers who vaccinate their children against polio?
* What is the impact of a natural dye on the durability of recycled PET?

Not necessary, and ideally avoided in your own project

# Your turn!  Write out a research question using the PICOT or PCOT method (5 minutes) {background-color="#4C326A"}

We will discuss (15 minutes)

Ok, so we have our research questions which are technically good (we can analyze the data), but is it work asking? To assess whether it’s possible or useful we use the FINER framework:

* Feasible:
* Interesting:
* Novel:
* Ethical:
* Relevant:

## For your projects, you don’t need to worry too much about whether it is “Novel” but it should be interesting and relevant (either for ETH, ERZ, etc.)
